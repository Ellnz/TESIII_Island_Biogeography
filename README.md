# Vvardenfell - Habitats
A compilation of replacers that focus on the wilderness (both biotic and abiotic!) of Vvardenfell.

## Prerequisites:
Before installing Vvardenfell-Habitats, first install:
Patch for Purists
Morrowind Optimization Patch
Intelligent Textures (if using #02 or @04)

## 01 Leafy Trees
Replaces the vanilla tree models with new models that have a far higher density of leaves, as while as some UV fixes and optimizations. Can be used with either vanilla textures, or replacers textures in 02.
Covers: AI

## 02 HD Plant Pack
A collection of HD replacers for most flora textures and smaller flora meshes (both static plants and organic containers). All replacers have been created with a specific focus on spatial and stylistic homogeny with vanilla assets. 

## 03 Rock Rollout
Rock model replacers based upon Nich's Seamless UV rocks replacer. These rocks have the aforementioned UV fixes, as well as improved collision meshes and some slight (so tasteful) smoothing around the most jagged parts.

## 04 LTex Override
A complete re-work of Otis_Geo's Vanilla Land, designed to be even more analogous with vanilla designs and colours. Intended to be installed over Intelligent Textures. Also downscales the textures from 2048x to 1024. Designed to be used alongside  HD Tamriel Data's Ltex textures.

## New Zealand Plants:
As I am a New Zealand ecologist, numerous indigenous plants from Aotearoa have made their way into the mod. Big thanks to Prof. Gillman for many of the original source textures.
- Metrosideros robusta (northern rata) -> tx_leaves_02 (AI leaves bright)
- Fuscospora cliffortioides (mountain beech) -> tx_leaves_01 (AI leaves dark)
- Phyllocladus trichomanoides (Tanekaha) -> tx_leaves_03 (AI bush)
- Syzygium maire (Swamp maire) -> ash tam leaf
- Coprosma tenuifolium -> black anther leaf, willow anther leaf
- Libocedrus plumosa (Kawaka)-> chokeweed
- Rhabdothamnus solandri (taurepo) -> gold kanet flowers
- Olearia angulata -> stoneflower leaf
- Entelea arborescens -> gold kanet flower

all the tx_bc and tree bark textures are from an unknown source, having been on my harddrive for years. Will be phased out later.
